  ## Description
  This is an application that allows you to create and save notes for yourself. In the future when I get caught up on my homework assignments, I will be coming back to add a delete function for the application. Currently you can only create and save notes.

  ## Installation
  In your terminal you will run the following commands - npm i, npm i path, npm i fs, and npm i uniqid.

  ## Usage
  Recommend using this application to set up any reminder notes you may need.

  ## Contributors
  Myself.

  ## Testing
  Currently no test available.
